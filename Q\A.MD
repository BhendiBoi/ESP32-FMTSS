__PROBLEM STATEMENT__

1. What is the *major problem* you are trying to address?

A. In the Current pandemic what are the two most important things? \[**Judges reply** (Washing hands and Masks)\] So we are trying to address the elephant in the room, people not using masks and going outside. This can be the biggest factor of spread covid-19 because as you go out you meet many people such as salesmen and vendors and it gets pretty dangerous.

2. Mention about the *current scenario* of the *sector*.

A. Many people are getting affected with covid-19 due to lack of usage of masks. A study by Japanese researchers found out that masks block about 60% of the amount of virus which comes out of a person's mouth. So if everyone wears a mask, the community spread can reduce by 60%! Isn't that great!!!

3. Which *SDG* does your problem come under?

A. Our problem comes under SDG 3, Good Health and Well-being.


__SOLUTION__

1. What is your **solution** to the problem being addressed?

A. Our solution is a face mask detection system. This system can be placed outside a public entrance and will look out for people who arent interested in wearing masks.

2. **Highlight the uniqueness** of your *solution* along with the **technical details** of list of *features*.

A. The unique thing about our project is our IP camera which means this is fully wireless since we're transmitting over wifi. This will be inputted to our program which finds out if an individual is wearing a mask or not.

The technologies we have used are:
  1. ESP32 CAM for camera input
  2. Python for the face detection program which takes input from the ESP32 CAM
  3. Arduino IDE for programming ESP32 CAM
  4. OLED display for displaying messages
  5. MAchine Learning

The ESP32 CAM records footage and passes it on to the computer, the computer takes the input, applies the algorithm and gives an output. This output is used to open a gate, sound a buzzer etc.

This can also be livestreamed and used as a low cost surveillance camera with some modifications. The face detection algorithm can also be visualized in this stream.

When a person without a mask is detected, access is denied and the individual is kindly warned to wear his/her face mask appropriately.
it also draws a red box around his/her face.
When Worn properly Access is granted and a green box is drawn.


We have modified Chandrika Deb's code in our project. We are thankful for her help.

3. **How** do you think the solution will **help the problem**?

This solution can help by mitigating the risk of spread of infection by discouraging improper use of masks.

{**Caution: This is the key slide ðŸ‘†. Be to the point and clear**}


__TEAM__

1. Describe the **key players** of your team and your **elite mentors** if you have any.

A. All three team members have given their best in building and planning this project. Sanath shet was in charge of programming the ESP32 as well as managing the project and presentation. Rishon fernandes played a key role in the face detection algorithm as well as taking input from the esp32 CAM. Nandan bhandary was responsible for managing input and output of the system.

__MARKET REACH__ Rishon is an absolute madlad

1. Is the market large enough to have people facing this problem / to pay for this solution?

A. 

2. Who else can use your solution other than the ones facing the problem?

A.
