__PROBLEM STATEMENT__

1. What is the *major problem* you are trying to address?

A. In the Current pandemic what are the two most important things? \[**Judges reply** (Washing hands and Masks)\] So we are trying to address the elephant in the room, people not wearing masks and going out. This can be the biggest cause of covid-19 because as you go out you meet many people such as salesmen and vendors and it gets pretty dangerous.

2. Mention about the *current scenario* of the *sector*.

A. The current scenario is that many people are getting affected with covid due to not wearing masks. A study by Japanese researchers found out that masks block about 60% of the amount of virus which comes out of a person's mouth. So if everyone wears a mask, the community spread can reduce by 60%! Isn't that great!!!

3. Which *SDG* does your problem come under?

A. Our problem comes under SDG 3, Good Health and Well-being.


__SOLUTION__

1. What is your **solution** to the problem being addressed?

A. Our solution is a face mask detection system. In this system the video capture of the people will be sent to our program. This will run it and tell us if there is a person who is wearing a mask or not.

2. **Highlight the uniqueness** of your *solution* along with the **technical details** of list of *features*.

A. The unique thing about our project is our IP camera which we're transmitting over wifi. Our solution uses a wireless camera, which will input to our program, detecting faces in our program.

The technologies we have used are:
  1. ESP32 cam for camera input
  2. Arduino IDE for programming the ESP32
  3. Python for the face detection program which takes input from the ESP32 cam
  4. Vs code for editing the python code

We have used Chandrika Deb's code in our project which we cloned from github. We are really gratefull for her help.

3. **How** do you think the solution will **help the problem**?
