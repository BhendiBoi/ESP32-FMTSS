# Hello from the creativiteam

We are making a face mask detection system for our Sahyadri Science Talent Hunt(ssth).

Our steps are: 
  1. Get input from Esp. 
  2. Give image to python program. 
  3. Use OpenCV or any other such library to detect faces.
  4. If there is a library to do face mask detection, use it.
  5. Else do it on our own.
  6. Timings 12.40-1.20, 2.15-4, 7.15-9.15.
