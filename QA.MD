Good morning everyone
I am Rishon Fernandes, I am Sanath Shet and we are the Creativiteam.
Today we are here to present our project, The PROTECHT.
It is a Face Mask + Temperature Detection and Sanitization System.
So lets begin without any further ado.

__PROBLEM STATEMENT__

1. What is the *major problem* you are trying to address?

A. In the Current pandemic what are the two most important things? \[**Judges reply** (Washing hands and Masks)\] So we are trying to address the elephant in the room, people not using masks and going outside. This can be the biggest factor of spread covid-19 because as you go out you meet many people such as salesmen and vendors and it gets pretty dangerous.

2. Mention about the *current scenario* of the *sector*.

A. Many people are getting affected with covid-19 due to lack of usage of masks. A study by Japanese researchers found out that masks block about 60% of the amount of virus which comes out of a person's mouth. So if everyone wears a mask, the community spread can reduce by 60%! Isn't that great!!!

3. Which *SDG* does your problem come under?

A. Our problem comes under SDG 3, Good Health and Well-being.


__SOLUTION__

1. What is our **solution** to the problem being addressed?

A. Our solution is a face mask detection system.
This system can be placed outside a public entrance and will look out for people who arent interested in taking care of themselves and the public.

2.a) **What is the uniqueness** of our *solution* and the list of **features**?

A. The unique thing about our project is our IP camera which means this is fully wireless since we're transmitting over wifi.
This will be inputted to our program which finds out if an individual is wearing a mask or not.

This is an all rounder which checks a person for the three essentials during covid:
Face Masks, Temperature Checks and finally Hand Sanitization.

Our project is also unique because without being checked for the three essentials, you won't be granted access.

The wireless temperature sensor checks temperature and gives output. If all's good, we move on to the next step.
Then the ESP32 CAM records footage and passes it on to the computer, the computer takes the input, applies the algorithm and gives an output.
Then the auto sanitizer sanitizes the person's hands.

All of the outputs are used to open a gate, sound a buzzer etc.

When a person's temperature is not normal or if a person without a mask is detected, access is denied and the individual is kindly warned to wear his/her face mask appropriately.

2.b) along with the **technical details** of .
The technologies we have used are:
  1. ESP32 CAM for camera input
  2. Python for the face detection program which takes input from the ESP32 CAM
  3. Arduino IDE for programming ESP32 CAM
  4. OLED display for displaying messages
  5. MAchine Learning




We have modified Chandrika Deb's code in our project. We are thankful for her help.

3. **How** do you think the solution will **help the problem**?

This solution can help by mitigating the risk of spread of infection by discouraging improper use of masks.

{**Caution: This is the key slide ðŸ‘†. Be to the point and clear**}


__TEAM__

1. Describe the **key players** of your team and your **elite mentors** if you have any.

A. I, Rishon Fernandes is incharge of 
Taking input from the ESP32 cam,
Implementing the face mask detection algorithm, communication between the esp32 and python and streaming the result to a webpage,
Managing online collaboration
and Managing the presentation
I am also coding in HTML, Python and CSS

__MARKET REACH__ 

1. Is the market large enough to have people facing this problem / to pay for this solution?

A. Our product costs around Rs1500.
It is applicable in markets since almost every market place has a PC
Who are the people facing this problem: Everyone
It is totally affordable and pretty cheap for the functions it offers.

2. Who else can use your solution other than the ones facing the problem?

A. This is applicable for any business/public place/Home during the pandemic
After the corona virus subdues, people can use this system as a surveillance camera, theft detectorâ€¦ etc.
